# GDS: Effects of Ice Breakup on the Yukon Delta, AK

Addison Pletcher | Kelly Bonnville-Sexton 

An analysis on river ice breakup timing in the Yukon River Delta of Alaska. The goal of this study is to better understand the seasonal relationships between communities that utilize the waterways for travel. 

### Summary 
This project seeks to understand the timing and extent of ice breakup as it relates to travel between local communities in the Yukon Delta. Understanding where travel corridors exist during periods of melting/freezing is important to the safety of those traveling. 

### Problem Statement
Seasonal variability of river ice breakup alters accessibility throughout the region, and climate change stands to exacerbate these timing changes in the future.
