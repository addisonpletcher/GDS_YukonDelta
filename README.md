An analysis on river ice breakup timing in the Yukon River Delta of Alaska. The goal of this study is to better understand the seasonal relationships between communities that utilize the waterways for travel. 

### Summary 
This project seeks to understand the timing and extent of ice breakup as it relates to travel between local communities in the Yukon Delta. Understanding where travel corridors exist during periods of melting/freezing is important to the safety of those traveling. 

### Problem Statement
Seasonal variability of river ice breakup alters accessibility throughout the region, and climate change stands to exacerbate these timing changes in the future. 

### Datasets
Earth Observation Imagery: TBD (MODIS/Sentinel-2/etc.)
Open Street Map: travel routes 

### Python packages and dependencies: 
spyder, matplotlib, geopandas, numpy, rasterio, osmnx, networkx, pandas, jupyter, shapely, jupyterlab, rioxarray, scikit-learn, selenium, bs4, descartes, momepy, folium

### Methods
Acquire imagery, access digitized routes that currently exist in the Delta, visualize timing of river ice breakup, attempt to connect ice breakup to travel routes in some capacity

### Outcomes
Information regarding timing of safe travel, changes in timing of ice breakup, etc.
